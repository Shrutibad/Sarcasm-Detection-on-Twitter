# Sarcasm-Detection-on-Twitter
Data mining project

I have implemened the the above paper which uses a behavioural modelling approach to classifiy tweets of a particular User.
I have used an SVM classifier to classifu the tweets as either sarcastic or non-sarcastic based on some features calculated
from users past tweets and some calculated from the tweet which is being classified.

The whole project has been built in python. However we used Java Twitter API for collecting the dataset.
